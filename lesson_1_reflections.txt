when I ran the program it cearly represented all the new lines that were added 
or removed making corrections if nessesary simple.


this will make things alot easier and more managable then having to remember
 to make a new version of your files. You will be able to compare any files for the given date.


you can find where the commit was made due to the comments. then take the git log command 
to get the lof to find the actual commits. After that you use the git diff to find the difference in the files
to see how many lines were added and discarded.


you could always go back and forth from commits.

I would like to use git as a medium for future projects.
